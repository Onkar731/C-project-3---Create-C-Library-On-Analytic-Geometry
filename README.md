# C-project-3---Create-C-Library-On-Analytic-Geometry
C project 3    -   Basically this project is to create a C Library on Analytic Geometry. While making this project I understand that not only programming is important but also we have to understand the implicit structure of a language like inbuilt library, header files and other important things. We should know how to create our own library, header files etc. This project makes me more familiar with internal structure of a language and better understanding of library file, header file, how files are linked at the time of compilation and give me little bit more understanding of how was code written while creating a language.
